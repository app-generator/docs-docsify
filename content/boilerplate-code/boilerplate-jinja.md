# Boilerplate Jinja

**Jinja** is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response. For those who have not been exposed to a templating language before, such languages essentially contain variables as well as some programming logic, which when evaluated (or rendered into HTML) are replaced with actual values.&#x20;

> Features:

* UI Ready: the starter contains a `production-ready` design
* Render Engine: Flask / [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com)
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU
